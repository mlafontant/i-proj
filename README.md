# CodeSmith Solo Project

This will be my first project during the CodeSmith program to be completed independently. One of the core goals of this project is to solidify material learned over the course of the program as well begin to explore new concepts on our own. 

I will be using this time to develop a deeper understanding of React and Redux with a particular emphasis on implementing teh observer and singleton patterns. Stretch goals include implementing caching / time-to-live (TTL), and leveraging existing libraries such as Immutable.js or Reactive.
